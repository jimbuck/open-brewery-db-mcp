# Open Brewery DB MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that provides access to the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) API. This server enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to search for breweries, get detailed brewery information, and explore brewery data from around the world.

## About Open Brewery DB

[Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) is a free and open-source API that provides comprehensive information about breweries worldwide. The database includes:

- **40,000+ breweries** from around the globe
- Detailed brewery information including names, types, locations, and contact details
- Regular updates from community contributions
- No authentication required for basic usage

### Brewery Types

The API categorizes breweries into several types:

- **micro** - Most craft breweries. For example, Samuel Adams is still considered a micro brewery
- **nano** - An extremely small brewery which typically only distributes locally
- **regional** - A regional location of an expanded brewery. Ex. Sierra Nevada Asheville
- **brewpub** - A beer-focused restaurant or restaurant/bar with a brewery on-premise
- **large** - (DEPRECATED) A very large brewery. Likely not for visitors. Ex. Miller-Coors
- **planning** - A brewery in planning or not yet opened to the public
- **bar** - (DEPRECATED) A bar. No brewery equipment on premise
- **contract** - A brewery that uses another brewery's equipment
- **proprietor** - Similar to contract brewing but refers to a brewery incubator
- **closed** - A location which has been closed
